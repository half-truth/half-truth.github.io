> The difference between your taste and ability to describe there's a gap and ability to make there's another gap. If you're a software maker you actually know what the bugs are. I know how things are roughly made. So I can describe it and I know how to fix it. Computing are just like reading and writing. It's a medium that you can shape. But until recently, computing is by and large the medium that only the programmer class can shape.
