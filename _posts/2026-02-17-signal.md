> "The numbers are staggering. **The top 1% of venture-backed exits are doubling in value every five years**—not a one-time spike, but a consistent pattern across two decades of data."  
> "VenCap’s data shows the 99th percentile exits went from $1.4 billion in 2005-2009 to a projected $20 billion for 2025 and beyond. The 90th percentile? From $524 million to $5.75 billion over the same period. That’s roughly 10x growth in outcomes for the best startups."

> "My personal experience as a founder and builder taught me that a startup is an insanely painful journey. It's super hard, and like it or not, you're going to face a lot of challenges. And that made me believe I shouldn't simply look for the smartest person in the room. High IQ helps.  
**The most important thing, in my view, is the adversity and the ability to overcome it. For me, this is the greatest
signal, the best signal for a terrific founder**."  

> "It's part of what I need. It always goes there. **But I learned that what's important in the story is not the what, it's the why. It's not about what you did; it's about why you did it, why you chose to do that, why you pick job A instead of job B, and why you pick that partner in life instead of another partner.  
It's always about the why. So it's not just about a unique, heartbreaking life story. It's about spending time with an
individual and understanding the way they make decisions, the way they analyze situations, what drives them, and what
really makes them tick.** And it's not so much about what they did or what accomplishments they managed to achieve. It's always nice to know that, but that's not what's important."  

> "I always speak with founders about their superpowers. What do they perceive as their superpower? What makes them confident that they can win the game?  
You speak with a founder—speak with an individual for a good hour—and you've got a fairly good perspective of what you think is their superpower.  
**And it's fascinating to listen to the way they perceive themselves. I found out that some of the best founders are completely unaware of their superpowers. They're so natural in that they don't mean to use them; they are just so great at it. And a superpower can be anything.  
For example, you're simply the type of person that people are dying to be friends with. You don't notice that. You think that that's a gift everyone has. You don't realize that this is your gift and that's what paved the way for your success.  
In many cases, the superpower they claim they have is not necessarily the real superpower they possess, but it shows you
the way they view their weaknesses—because the superpower they are aware of, they pay attention to, having developed it
in compensation for something else. So that tells you a lot about the person ahead of you**."  

> "It's not the way I think about the future of cybersecurity. I don't keep a category of domains, etc. **It's a common
> misconception to think about cybersecurity as a standalone market. There's no cybersecurity market. Cybersecurity is
> always a derivative of something else, of a new technology or a new business**.  
So if cloud is new, you need cloud security, and if autonomous vehicles are new, you need autonomous vehicle security. Take, for instance, our conversation about AI. AI, for short, redefines cybersecurity. It already does, but you couldn't predict it.  
So an investor who focuses on early-stage cybersecurity investment—I'm not concerned with figuring out the best or the most important things, opportunities, or domains in cybersecurity. I'm confident they will introduce themselves in the same way that cloud security, IoT security, mobile security, and AI security did.  
I'm focused on picking the right talent, choosing the right athletes, partnering with them, and making sure that you use the right system—see our conversation around Sunrise—to really build solutions that real customers and real users would love. If we do that, everything else will fix itself."

> There are also not too many primitives. You want a system which is efficiently expressive. Like, you can say complex things with the minimum of vocabulary. Why? Because then the person using the notation can hold it in their head.

It matters what you can hold in your head because then the notation becomes a tool for the imagination.
